  <p>Welcome</p>
  <img id="profile_img" src="./assets/img/panosai.png">
    My name is Panos Kapetanidis and I am a Computer Engineer with specific research interest in Machine/Deep Learning. 
    I was born in Heidelberg, Germany, and raised in Luxembourg, I completed my high school education on the island of Lesbos, Greece.
    Recently, I earned my diploma in Computer Engineering and Informatics from the University of Patras.
    During my time there, and continuing thereafter, I worked as a Research Engineer focusing on applying Machine Learning to medical audio data.
    Currently, I'm pursuing the Advanced Masters of AI program at KU Leuven, Belgium.
    
    In addition to Software Engineering and Machine Learning, I have a keen interest in Jazz music, particularly Jazz and Gypsy Jazz guitar, as well as the Double bass.
    I've been playing the guitar since I was 10 years old, and I'm currently learning to play the Jazz Double bass.

    One of my other hobbies is calisthenics, which combines elements of gymnastics and weightlifting exercises.
    It's my primary workout routine, focusing solely on bodyweight/weighted bodyweight exercises that involve both static and dynamic movements.
